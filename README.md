# [jackinfurs.ie](https://jackinfurs.ie/)
there isn't an awful lot for me to say here, besides how to build/deploy jekyll statically.

**if you discover any bugs, please use the [issues](https://github.com/jackinfurs/jackinfurs.github.io/issues) tab if you're inclined.**

## deploying the blog
you can just run `build-and-run.sh` in the root dir.

if ur gna be writing blogposts then make sure to structure them as **[yyyy-mm-dd]-[title].md**, otherwise they won't be indexed.

example: `2026-01-07-test.md`.
